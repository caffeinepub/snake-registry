# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a dynamic 2D snake visualization that grows by one segment each time a user registers with a username.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a user registration system with username input
- Implement backend logic to track snake segments (one segment per registered user)
- Create a 2D canvas visualization where the snake continuously moves in an animated pattern
- Display real-time visual updates showing the snake growing as new users register
- Design a vibrant, playful visual theme with smooth animations

**User-visible outcome:** Users can register with a username and watch a colorful, animated snake grow longer on screen in real-time as more people join, with a continuously moving snake that automatically adds segments for each new registration.
